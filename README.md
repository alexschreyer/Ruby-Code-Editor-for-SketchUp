How to install this plugin in SketchUp:
=======================================

Download the ZIP file and unzip its contents into the SketchUp plugin directory
(usually at C:\Program Files\Google\SketchUp\Plugins\ in Windows
or /Library/Application Support/Google SketchUp/SketchUp/Plugins/ on the Mac).

Keep the folder structure as it is in the ZIP file. Make sure the file called
as_loadrubyeditor.rb ends up in the SketchUp Plugins directory.
Then re-start SketchUp and look for the new menu item in the Windows menu.
If you are updating, just overwrite the old version of this plugin.
